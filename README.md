# :bust_in_silhouette:Introduction:

As one of the fastest-growing industries in the world, E-commerce sales have increased 170% over the past 5 years (2015 - 2020). Global e-commerce jumps to $26.7 trillion, fuelled by COVID-19. More and more merchants are moving their physical stores to online. The Internet makes selling online easier than a decade ago, it lowers the barrier of being a seller.

However, it's extremely difficult to stand out from thousands of sellers. The object of this project is trying to give online sellers in Hong Kong, especially those who sell on HKTV mall, a brief insight into how the E-commerce market looks like, and a few product recommendations.
